<h2>Mandatory part</h2> <p>The procedure is based on two phases, the creation of the [vulnerable program] and the construction of the payload that will be sent to it during execution. After creating and verifying that the developed application is vulnerable, it is time to create an exploit that allows you to take advantage of that vulnerability. Together, the following steps must be followed:</p> <ul> <li>Creation of the exploit. The program will be called <code>tsunami.exe</code> and will receive a single parameter as an argument.</li> <li>Payload creation, which will automatically open the [Windows XP calculator] when the vulnerability is exploited.</li> <li>The payload must contain the code to be executed in shellcode. Building your own payload is a fundamental part of the technique. Document yourself to analyze and understand what the existing ones are like, but try to develop your own payload instead of surrendering to Shell-storm.</li> </ul>
